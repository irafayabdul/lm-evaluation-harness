Title: `OpenPI2.0: An Improved Dataset for Entity Tracking in Texts`

Abstract: `https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14603`

Much text describes a changing world (e.g., procedures, stories, newswires), and understanding them requires tracking how entities change.
An earlier dataset, OpenPI, provided crowdsourced annotations of entity state changes in text.
However, a major limitation was that those annotations were free-form and did not identify salient changes, hampering model evaluation.
To overcome these limitations, we present an improved dataset, OpenPI2.0, where entities and attributes are fully canonicalized and additional entity salience annotations are added.
